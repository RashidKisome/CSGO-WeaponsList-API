# CSGO-WeaponsList-API
I made a very simple node api listing all the weapons from CSGO ( Counter-Strike: Global Offensive ), It's one of my favorite games and my intent is to use this simple data and build projects with it, it lists all the weapons on CSGO, their in game prices along with png images.
If you are lazy like like me, here is a link http://www.json-generator.com/api/json/get/cdXlWKtOiG?indent=2 you can fetch from if you want to use this for a project.
