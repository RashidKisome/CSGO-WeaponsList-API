# CSGO-WeaponsList-API
I made a very simple node api listing all the weapons from CSGO ( Counter-Strike: Global Offensive ), It's one of my favorite games and my intent is to use this simple data and build projects with it, it lists all the weapons in CSGO, their in game prices along with png images.
If you are lazy like me, here is a link  http://www.json-generator.com/api/json/get/cdXlWKtOiG?indent=2 you can fetch from if you want to use this for a project, 
or simply just copy the json if you are even lazier or fork the project itself if you want to tweak or add to it for your own use case.....
